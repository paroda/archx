# archx
My Arch linux dotfiles for Vmware or Virtualbox virtual machine

Primarily a Clojure development environment with Emacs in Tile window manager

## Tools
- Window Manager - i3wm
- Editor - Emacs
- Terminal - Alacritty
- Web browser - Google Chrome

## Setup
See [Setup.md](Setup.md)

This is primarily for Vmware virtual machine. There is another branch [virtualbox](https://github.com/paroda/archx/tree/virtualbox) 
which is for Vitrualbox virtual machines. However, it is a bit old. I am no longer actively using it.
